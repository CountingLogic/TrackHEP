# Neural Network for track reconstruction
- The folder TrackingHEP contains a Simulator for generating particle collision data.
- Two Deep Learning Models, the first of which is for seeding and the second for reconstruction.
- It also contains a trained Deep Learning Model. With various models saved with different parameters.

PS: I dont have the time to make a detailed README. But any one interested can directly contact me at sagarmalhotra0594@gmail.com
